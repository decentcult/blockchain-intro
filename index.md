# Corruption
 Historically, when it comes to transacting money or anything of value, people and businesses have relied heavily on intermediaries like banks and governments to ensure trust and certainty. Middlemen perform a range of important tasks that help build trust into the transactional process like authentication & record keeping.

Blockchain as a history writing method
Controllable emission, transparent transactions

# What is blockchain

Immutable distributed ledger or decentralized transaction database.
A trustless and distributed consensus system means that if you want to send and/or receive money from someone you don’t need to trust in third-party services.

# What is not blockchain
“[Blockchain] is to Bitcoin, what the internet is to email. A big electronic system, on top of which you can build applications. Currency is just one.” — Sally Davies, FT Technology Reporter

# Ledger record

# What is block
Block is 'current' part of a blockchain which records some or all of the recent transactions, and once completed goes into the blockchain as permanent database. Blocks are cryptographically protected and placed in chronological order with every block containing hash of the previous block.

# Immutability
Nobody has control over database, prior to no centralized server. Thus, nobody can alter order or data store in the blockchain. Given whole history of transaction we can get balance of each particular address at the certain timestamp.

# Mining and token emission

# Usage of blockchain
By enabling the digitization of assets, blockchain is driving a fundamental shift from the Internet of information, where we can instantly view, exchange and communicate information to the Internet of value, where we can instantly exchange assets.

Currency
Multi-functional tokens: votes, contracts, record loans, stock transfers, identity resolution, health records, proof of ownership.
